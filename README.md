# Ethereum War Game and CTF Tooling

## EthClient

Simple elixir client to interact with the ethereum blockchain, deploying and calling smart contracts.

### Configuration

All global configuration is kept in the `EthClient.Context` module, which holds the following values:

- `rpc_host`: The hostname needed to interact with the ethereum Json RPC API. This can be an infura-type url or just the hostname of an actual node.
- `chain_id`: The id of the chain currently in use (`1` for mainnet, `4` for Rinkeby, etc).
- `user_account`: A value of type `EthClient.Account`, which holds two fields, `address` and `private_key`. This is the account used to sign and send all transactions.
- `current_contract`: The address of the contract we're currently interacting with.

You can change any of these config values at runtime by using the functions exposed by the `EthClient.Context` module.

The default config assumes you're running the local ethereum network this repo provides.

If you want to use infura-type host this are the setps you must follow:

First set your infura api key

```
Context.set_infura_api_key("your_infura_api_key")
```

Then set the your etherscan api key

```
Context.set_etherscan_api_key("your_eth_scan_api_key")
```

And finally set the name of the chain you want to use, for now this are the supported chains: eht mainnet, rinkeby and ropsten.

```
EthClient.set_chain("chain_name")
```

### Interacting with smart contracts

Currently there are three functions in the `EthClient` module that form the main API:

- `EthClient.deploy(bin_path)`  deploys a compiled smart contract given a path to its `.bin` file, generated by compiling said contract (i.e. by running something like `solc --bin contract.sol`). After a successful deployment, the context will be updated to use it.

- `EthClient.call(method, arguments)` calls any read-only public method of a contract.

- `EthClient.invoke(method, arguments, amount)` calls any public method of a contract that requires a transaction (usually to write stuff to the blockchain). The `amount` parameter controls how much `eth` is sent to the contract.

Currently, both `call` and `invoke` require the user to know the contract's method signatures; this will change soon when we start parsing the ABI of the contract and offer a better API.

### Example

When running `iex -S mix`, there will be a default `bin_path` variable loaded with the path to a compiled `Storage` contract. You can then immediately deploy it with

```
EthClient.deploy(bin_path)
```

and then call each of its functions. If you're running the local ethereum network, you should see something like the following:

```
iex(1)> EthClient.deploy(bin_path)
19:53:26.918 [info]  Deployment transaction accepted by the network, tx_hash: 0x14765466533a85c90ce45dd966854dc5fb95543ba97f343f389872c64ed9597b

```

```
iex(2)> EthClient.call("test_function()", [])
{:ok, "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"}
```

```
iex(3)> EthClient.invoke("store(uint256)", [20], 0)
19:55:28.127 [info]  Transaction accepted by the network, tx_hash: 0x137320dcfb61055313f73aafa799670a4d172936bc91200ebf7a95092f77c297

```

```
iex(4)> EthClient.call("retrieve()", [])
{:ok, "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014"}
```

## Local nodes
Install dependencies with

```
make init
```

then source your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or similar files to add foundry to your `PATH`, then run `foundryup` to install `forge` and `cast`.

To run two local Ethereum nodes:

```
cd geth_nodes
make setup
make up
```

## Accounts
You can use the miner accounts to pay for transactions.

Node 1 miner account

- Address: `0xafb72ccaeb7e22c8a7640f605824b0898424b3da`
- Private key: `e90d75baafee04b3d9941bd8d76abe799b391aec596515dee11a9bd55f05709c`

Node 2 miner account:

- Address: `0x77b648683cde1d69544ed6f4f7204e8d51c324db`
- Private key: `f71d3dd32649f9bdfc8e4a5232d3f245860243756f96fbe070c31fc44c9293f4`


## Test contract

You can then deploy the test contract with

```
make deploy_test_contract
```

under the root directory.

The code for this contract is in `contracts/src/Storage.sol`; it has 3 functions: `test_function` will always return `1`, `store(uint256)` stores the given number and `retrieve()` returns said number.

The output should look like this

```
forge create --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 Storage --root contracts/ --private-key df57089febbacf7ba0bc227dafbffa9fc08a93fdc68e1e42411a14efcf23656e

Deployer: 0x8626f6940e2eb28930efb4cef49b2d1f2c9c1199
Deployed to: 0xb581c9264f59bf0289fa76d61b2d0746dce3c30d
Transaction hash: 0xe2c19a2f0766c0e00c416433a8cf53c9993fc918e2b321f348d8de421c195416
```

Take note of the address you are given after `Deployed to:`, as that is the contract's address in the local chain.
With it, you can now call its test function using `cast` like this:

```
cast call <contract_address> "test_function()(uint256)" --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

which should return `1`.


You can also send a transaction to call the `store` function

```
cast send <contract_address> --private-key <private_key> "store(uint256)" 5 --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

where the private key needs to have some funds to pay for the transaction (for this you can use one of the miner accounts). Output should look like this

```
blockHash            "0xd2f9afae4ef28c63ceccd7575c4370c17ead74448567ca651ec82a7051434e01"

transactionIndex     "0x0"
type                 "0x2"
```

After storing a number, you can retrieve it with

```
cast call <contract_address> "retrieve()(uint256)" --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```
### Code

Apart from EthClient calls, other modules can be called. 

- RPC module handles RPC calls to the node. 
- ABI module is a helper used to get the ABI of the desired contract, either calling to etherscan or locally.
- The Contract module uses the ABI module to generate elixir functions that invoke/call the said methods in the contract.
- The Account module defines a struct for accounts
- The Context module saves the current context, ie. contract ABI and address, and is updated as used. It is maintained with a Supervisor process.
- The RawTransaction module handles encoding of transactions for sending. (via RPC module)
- The Application module handles environment
